# GenAI_LangChain
Large Language Models(LLMs) are trained on massive amounts of text data to learn patterns and entity relationships in the language. LLMs use Deep Learning algorithms to process and understand natural language processing, translating and analyzing sentiments as well as generating new texts using similarity serach.
